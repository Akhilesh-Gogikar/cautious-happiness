CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS Not Applicable
FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to financial technology and artificial intelligence. More specifically, it relates to systems for algorithmic trading on binary option and prediction market exchanges, utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for probability estimation and dynamic position sizing based on order book depth.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Prediction markets allow participants to trade shares on the outcome of future events (e.g., "Will Candidate X win the election?"). Unlike traditional equity markets, these instruments are typically binary options that resolve to strictly $0 or $1.
Current tools for participating in these markets suffer from two primary technical deficiencies:
Probability Estimation Failure: Existing automated tools rely on "black box" Large Language Models (LLMs) that are prone to hallucination and poor calibration. A standard LLM might express 90% confidence in an incorrect prediction, leading to catastrophic capital loss.
Execution Inefficiency (The "Slippage" Problem): Retail traders and existing bots typically calculate position size based on the "best available price" (Top of Book). However, in markets with thin liquidity, a large order significantly moves the price (slippage). Standard algorithms fail to account for this price impact before placing the order, resulting in "negative expected value" (EV) execution despite a theoretically profitable signal.
There creates a need for a system that couples strict probabilistic calibration (Brier score optimization) with a liquidity-aware execution engine that dynamically sizes orders based on real-time market depth.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a system and method for "Calibrated Quantitative Execution."
Data Ingestion & Calibration: The system aggregates unstructured data (news, reports) and processes it through a specialized Language Model fine-tuned for Brier score minimization. Instead of binary outputs, the model generates a probability distribution with explicit confidence intervals.
Verification Layer: A secondary "Critic" module validates the probability against a curated whitelist of data sources to prevent hallucination.
Liquidity-Aware Sizing: A "Dynamic Kelly Engine" queries the exchange's Central Limit Order Book (CLOB). It simulates the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) for various bet sizes to find the equilibrium point where the user's edge is maximized relative to slippage.
Execution: The system automatically routes the optimized order to the exchange.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
1. The Calibrated Inference Module The system operates a local inference server running a modified Large Language Model (e.g., an 8-billion parameter transformer). Unlike general-purpose chatbots, this model is constrained by a "System Prompt" that enforces probabilistic output.
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): The system queries a "Trusted Data Store" (e.g., Reuters, AP, Official Government Statistics) relevant to the market in question.
Output Format: The model outputs a JSON object containing a probability_score (0.0 to 1.0) and a confidence_interval.
Calibration Check: The system compares the output against historical Brier scores for similar event types. If the model's confidence exceeds its historical accuracy threshold, the probability is dampened (regressed to the mean) before execution.
2. The Hallucination Firewall (The "Critic" Agent) Before any probability is acted upon, the probability_score is passed to a secondary, lightweight validation model. This "Critic" verifies that the primary model's cited reasoning exists within the retrieved source text. If the primary model cites a statistic that does not appear in the source text, the system flags the signal as "Null" and aborts the trade.
3. The Execution Engine (The "Slippage-Aware Kelly") This is the core execution logic. Standard Kelly Criterion logic (f∗=bbp−q​) assumes the user can bet infinite capital at the current market odds (b). The invention improves this by treating b as a dynamic variable.
Step A: The system ingests the "Ask" side of the order book (Price/Size tuples).
Step B: It iterates through increasing cumulative bet sizes ($10, $20, ... $N).
Step C: For each increment, it calculates the VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price).
Step D: It recalculates the Kelly Fraction using the VWAP. As the bet size increases, VWAP rises (odds worsen), and the Kelly Fraction decreases.
Step E: The system identifies the intersection point where Marginal Edge = Marginal Slippage Cost. This defines the optimal_order_size.
4. Semantic Correlation Discovery The system utilizes the LLM to identify non-obvious correlations between discrete markets. By mapping semantic relationships (e.g., "Interest Rates" ↔ "Housing Starts"), the system monitors for "Lag Arbitrage" where a price movement in a primary market has not yet reflected in a semantically linked secondary market.
CLAIMS
What is claimed is:
1. A computer-implemented method for automated algorithmic trading in electronic prediction markets, comprising: (a) identifying a specific binary event market on an electronic exchange; (b) retrieving unstructured context data relevant to said event from a pre-defined whitelist of trusted sources; (c) inputting said context data into a calibrated large language model (LLM) configured to output a probability score representing the likelihood of the event occurring; (d) retrieving the current Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) data for said event market, including available liquidity at multiple price levels; (e) calculating a Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) for a plurality of potential order sizes; (f) determining an optimal order size by applying a position-sizing algorithm that dynamically adjusts for the calculated VWAP at each potential order size; and (g) automatically transmitting an electronic order of said optimal size to the exchange.
2. The method of Claim 1, wherein the position-sizing algorithm is a Slippage-Aware Kelly Criterion. The algorithm iteratively calculates:
fadj∗​=(​Pmodel​−Pvwap​​)/(1−Pvwap)
Where Pmodel​ is the probability score derived from the LLM, and Pvwap​ is the effective market price including slippage for the specific order size being simulated.
3. The method of Claim 1, further comprising a validation step ("The Critic"). Prior to step (d), the generated probability score and associated reasoning are cross-referenced by a secondary automated agent against the retrieved context data. If the secondary agent determines the reasoning is not supported by the context data, the process is terminated.
4. The method of Claim 1, wherein the large language model is locally hosted. The inference process occurs on local hardware without transmitting sensitive strategy data to a third-party Application Programming Interface (API), ensuring strategy privacy and eliminating marginal cost per inference.
5. A system for executing predictive market trades, comprising: A memory storing a calibrated language model and a liquidity analysis module; A processor configured to: (i) ingest real-time market order books; (ii) generate event probabilities using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG); (iii) simulate the price impact of varying bet sizes; and (iv) execute a trade only when the simulated price impact does not negate the statistical edge provided by the generated probability.
ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE A system and method for automated execution in electronic prediction markets that eliminates the risk of "over-betting" in thin liquidity environments. The system utilizes a locally hosted, Brier-score-optimized Large Language Model to generate "True Probability" estimates for future events. These probabilities are fed into a proprietary "Slippage-Aware Kelly Engine" that walks the order book in real-time. The engine calculates the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) for potential bet sizes and executes the specific volume that maximizes bankroll growth while maintaining a positive expected value (EV) post-slippage. This ensures retail traders can act as algorithmic market makers without falling victim to predatory pricing or execution slippage.
