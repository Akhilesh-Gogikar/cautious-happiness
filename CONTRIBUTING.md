### Core Principles
- **Privacy First**: Sensitive strategy data should never leave the local environment unless explicitly authorized (e.g., executing a trade).
- **Verification**: All AI-generated claims must be verified by the "Critic" agent.
- **Institutional Quality**: UI/UX should feel like a Bloomberg Terminal or professional trading desk. "Data Noir" aesthetic is preferred.
